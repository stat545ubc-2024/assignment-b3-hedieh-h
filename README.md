# Orientation App

You can access the Orientation app using this link: https://hedieh.shinyapps.io/orientation/

## App Description

Back in 2023 I planned an orientation week for my college at UofT. Back then, we payed 5k to create an event app so students can access event information easily. I wanted to challenge myself to make this app using shiny apps!

This app contains an event schedule table for an orientation week. Users are able to filter the event list and select their desired events to view the event location on the campus map and read the detailed event description. If they wish to attend this event later, they can add this event to their schedule and once they add all their desired events to their schedule, the users can download their schedule to their device. 

 ## App Dataset Acknowledgement
 
The dataset used in this app was created by Hedieh Hashemi and is stored in this repository in the 'data' folder. The event list and descriptions were created by St. Michael's College Orientation 2023 team.
